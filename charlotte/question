Charlotte loves watching horse riding shows. Create a two column user menu that lets you view a list of ten different horse riding movies of your choice.

Create a function allowing the user to look at the rating of the movie as well as age restriction (3 movies). 

Finally you want the user to be able to add whichever movie of choice to a watch later list that can be updated continuously (minimum of 2 movies).
